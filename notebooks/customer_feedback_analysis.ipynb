    "1. ## Step 1: \n",
    "   We use 'list' with the name 'feedback' to display 5 elements in the 'feedback' variable.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. ## Step 2:\n",
    "   To remove whitespace at the beginning and end of a string, and convert all characters to lowercase, we use .strip() and .lower() with the variable name 'cleaned'.\n",
    "   \n",
    "4. ## Step 3:\n",
    "   We use .replace(a, b) to replace \"delivery\" with \"shipping\".\n",
    "\n",
    "5. ## Step 4:\n",
    "   We combine step 4 with step 6, and we will explain in step 6. Because if we write code in step 4, the result will be displayed twice for if, elif, else statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. ## Step 5:\n",
    "   We use .sort() to sort the response list alphabetically.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. ## Step 6:\n",
    "   ** print('Cleaned and Sorted Feedback:') --> We use print to display the first line of sample output.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ** print(cleaned2) --> We use print to display to list short customer feedback comments after strip, lower, replace and sort.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ** print('') --> We use it because it looks like a blank space or empty line if the string is empty (''), nothing is shown.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ** print(\"Total comments:\", len(cleaned2)) --> We use len(cleaned2) to count the number of elements in the list, so we can get the answer of total number of responses from customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ** print(\"First comment:\", cleaned2[0]) --> We use cleaned2[0] to get the first element in the list after sorting.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ** print(\"Last comment:\", cleaned2[-1]) --> We use cleaned2[-1] to get the last element in the list after sorting.\n",

    "        'if': If the customer feedback contains the word \"great\" or \"good\", print a 'Positive' label.\n",
    "        'elif': To continue the command, if the customer's response contains the word \"fast\" or \"shipping\" then print the 'Logistics-related' label.\n",
    "        'else': To display remaining cases, not covered by 'if' and 'elif', print the 'General' label.\n",
    "    --> We add 'f' before a string to insert variables inside the string using { }."
